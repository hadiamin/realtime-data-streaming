A real-time data streaming pipeline.

Covering each phase from **data ingestion** to **processing** and finally **storage**.

I utilize a powerful stack of tools and technologies, including:
Apache Airflow, 
Python, 
Apache Kafka, 
Apache Zookeeper, 
Apache Spark, 
Cassandra.

All neatly containerized using **Docker**.
